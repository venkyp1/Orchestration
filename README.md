### Orchestration

```

The documents about orchestration provides a quick overview of getting a cluster up & running and 
deploying your pods. The critical part of configuration is providing security to ensure the nodes, 
pods are accessible to only those who have the right priviledges to do so.

I will be covering another detailed tutorial on Kubernetes security soon.
